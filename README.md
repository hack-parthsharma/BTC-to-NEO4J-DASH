## Graph model

The graph consists of addresses and transactions. The transaction nodes contain the transaction hash and the timestamp and some preprocessed information like the total and the flow value of the transaction. The original input and output contributions are stored as relationship properties to allow multiple inputs and outputs with various contributions. The direction of the relationships indicates the flow of value.
